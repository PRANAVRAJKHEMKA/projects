Face Detection using OpenCV:

      This project uses OpenCVâ€™s computer vision capabilities to detect human faces in images or live video streams.
      It applies a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to identify facial features and draw bounding boxes around them in real time.

Features:

   Real-time face detection using a webcam

   Supports image and video input

   Lightweight and easy to run with Python & OpenCV
